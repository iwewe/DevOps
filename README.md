# DevOps Toolkit

Welcome to the DevOps Toolkit repository! This repository houses essential tools and configurations to streamline and enhance our DevOps practices.

## Overview

DevOps is all about collaboration, automation, and continuous improvement. This toolkit is designed to facilitate the automation of various tasks, enhance collaboration between development and operations teams, and ultimately improve the overall efficiency of our software delivery pipeline.

## Key Features

- **Infrastructure as Code (IaC):** Leverage IaC principles with tools like Terraform and Ansible to provision and manage infrastructure consistently.
- **Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD):** Implement CI/CD pipelines using Jenkins, GitLab CI, or other preferred tools to automate the software delivery process.
- **Containerization:** Utilize Docker for containerization, allowing for consistent environments across development, testing, and production.
- **Monitoring and Logging:** Implement robust monitoring and logging solutions, such as Prometheus and ELK stack, to gain insights into system performance and troubleshoot issues effectively.
- **Collaboration Tools:** Integrate collaboration tools like Slack, Microsoft Teams, or others to enhance communication and collaboration between development and operations teams.

## Folder Structure

- **/terraform:** Contains Terraform configurations for infrastructure provisioning.
- **/ansible:** Houses Ansible playbooks for configuration management and automation.
- **/docker:** Includes Dockerfiles and related configurations for containerization.
- **/scripts:** Stores various utility scripts used in the deployment pipeline.
